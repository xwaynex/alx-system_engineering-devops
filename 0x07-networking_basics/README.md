- What it is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized
- What is a LAN
- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size
# What is a WAN
- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size
- What is the Internet
- What is an IP address
- What are the 2 types of IP address
- What is localhost
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

# TCP/UDP
What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
What is a port
Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
# ALL TASKS!

Choose the number that corresponds to the right answer to the following Questions:
# Task 0: OSI model
What is the OSI model?
1. Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
2. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
3. The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology

How is the OSI model organized?
1. Alphabetically
2. From the lowest to the highest level
3. Randomly


# Task 1: Types of network

What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
  1. Internet
  2. WAN
  3. LAN
What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
Internet
  1. WAN
  2. LAN
What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?
  1. Internet
  2. WAN
  3. LAN

# Task 2: MAC and IP address

What is a MAC address?
  1. The name of a network interface
  2. The unique identifier of a network interface
  3. A network interface
What is an IP address?
  1. Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
  2. The unique identifier of a network interface
  3. Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

# Task 3: UDP and TCP

Letâ€™s fill the empty parts in the drawing above.
Questions:
Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
  1. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
  2. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
  1. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
  2. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
 Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
  1. Have you received boxes x, y, z?
  2. May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?

# Task 4: TCP and UDP ports

Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:
1. That only shows listening sockets,
2. That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs

# Task 5: Is the Host on the Network?

Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
Requirements:
1. Accepts a string as an argument
2. Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed 
3. Ping the IP 5 times
